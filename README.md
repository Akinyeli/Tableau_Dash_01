## Project Overview
A comprehensive Tableau-based analysis comparing two website versions (A and B) for DigitalPath Innovations, a leading digital marketing solutions company. This project evaluates user engagement, conversion metrics, feedback patterns, and referral sources to determine the more effective design for enhancing user experience and maximizing business outcomes.

## Project Objectives
Compare user engagement metrics between Version A and Version B
Analyze conversion rates and identify optimization opportunities
Evaluate user feedback and content interaction patterns
Assess the impact of different referral sources on performance
Provide data-driven recommendations for future design iterations

## Data Sources
User engagement data (pages viewed, session duration, user actions)
Conversion metrics (cart additions, checkout initiation, completed purchases)
User feedback responses
Content interaction statistics (video views, page interactions)
Referral source tracking data
Performance data spanning multiple months including April 2024

## Data Preprocessing
Consolidated metrics from multiple platforms into a unified dataset
Standardized engagement measurements across both website versions
Segmented data by referral sources, user demographics, and interaction types
Normalized temporal data to account for different testing periods
Filtered anomalous data points to ensure statistical validity

## Modeling
Created interactive Tableau dashboards featuring:

Comparative visualizations of key performance metrics
Time-series analysis of conversion funnels
Heat maps of user engagement patterns
Correlation analysis between feedback sentiment and user actions
Funnel analysis for conversion path optimization

## Evaluation Metrics
Session duration and pages viewed per user
Action completion rates
Cart addition to checkout ratio
Checkout to purchase conversion rate
User feedback sentiment analysis
Referral source effectiveness
Revenue potential indicators

## Key Insights
Version A significantly outperformed Version B in pages viewed and session duration
Version B's conversion rate was nearly 50% lower than Version A's
Both versions achieved 100% conversion rate in April 2024
Version A received more positive user feedback, likely due to its interface design
Version B users showed higher engagement with video content
Version B exhibited stronger SEO performance, attracting more search engine traffic
Version A received more direct referrals, indicating strong offline marketing

## Conclusion
Version A demonstrates superior overall performance with higher engagement metrics and conversion rates, making it the recommended foundation for future iterations. However, Version B shows potential in specific areas like video consumption and search engine optimization that should be incorporated. The optimal approach would combine Version A's user-friendly interface and conversion efficiency with Version B's content engagement strengths and SEO capabilities.
